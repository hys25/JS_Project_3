> JavaScript training

In this project, I learned how to divide the functionality into separate **modules(ES6)** and build the project using **webpack**. Also on this project I got acquainted with such technologies as: **JSON, AJAX, Promise(ES6), Fetch API, geting data from the server, async/await (ES8), npm, webpack, Babel, Core.js, polyfills, regular expressions** and others. I worked with the ready layout.

The site has such functionalities:
- tabs
- modal windows (including pop up after time. setTimeout and setInterval)
- timer 
- cards (*for dynamically creating cards*, I got acquainted with **functions-constructor**, execution context **this**, **classes** and created a small training database db.json)
- slider 
- calculator (you can calculate your calorie requirement for the day, you need to fill in your data)

The project is **validated** without errors and warnings, all **images are optimized**. The site is adaptive only for desktop.
